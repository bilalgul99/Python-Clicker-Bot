# Python-Clicker-Bot
This is a Python script that can automate mouse clicks on two positions on the screen. It can be useful for tasks that require repetitive clicking, such as online games, web testing, data entry, etc. The script uses the PyAutoGUI module to control the mouse and the keyboard module to detect key presses.
