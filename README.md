# Python Clicker Bot

This is a Python script that can automate mouse clicks on two positions on the screen. It can be useful for tasks that require repetitive clicking, such as online games, web testing, data entry, etc. The script uses the PyAutoGUI module to control the mouse and the keyboard module to detect key presses.

## How to use

- Run the script using `python clicker_bot.py`.
- Press `a` to record the first position to click. You will see a message on the console with the coordinates of the position.
- Press `b` to record the second position to click. You will see another message on the console with the coordinates of the position.
- The bot will start clicking the two positions alternately with a time gap of 3 seconds between each click.
- To stop the bot, press `q`. You will see a message on the console saying 'exiting'.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyAutoGUI module (`pip install pyautogui`)
- keyboard module (`pip install keyboard`)
